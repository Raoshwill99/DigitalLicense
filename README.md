# Blockchain-Based Digital Content Licensing Platform

## Project Overview

This project implements a decentralized platform for digital content licensing using blockchain technology. It allows creators to license their digital content (such as music, images, and videos) directly to users, leveraging the power of blockchain for secure transactions, automated royalty distributions, and transparent usage analytics.

### Key Features

- Direct licensing of digital content from creators to users
- Secure microtransactions using Bitcoin
- Complex licensing terms and usage tracking managed on Stacks blockchain
- Automated royalty distributions
- Transparent usage analytics for creators

## Technology Stack

- Stacks blockchain for smart contracts (using Clarity language)
- Bitcoin blockchain for microtransactions
- [Future implementation: Front-end framework (e.g., React, Vue.js)]

## Smart Contract Structure

The core functionality is implemented in Clarity smart contracts:

1. **Content Management**: Allows creators to add and manage their digital content.
2. **Licensing System**: Enables users to purchase licenses for content.
3. **License Validation**: Provides a mechanism to check the validity of licenses.

## Getting Started
