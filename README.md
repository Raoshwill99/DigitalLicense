# Blockchain-Based Digital Content Licensing Platform

## Overview

This project implements a decentralized platform for digital content licensing using blockchain technology. It allows creators to license their digital content (such as music, images, and videos) directly to users, leveraging the power of smart contracts for secure and transparent transactions.

### Key Features

- Content registration and management
- License purchasing and validation
- Automated royalty distributions (planned)
- Transparent usage analytics for creators (planned)
- Integration with Bitcoin for microtransactions (planned)

## Technology Stack

- Blockchain: Stacks
- Smart Contract Language: Clarity
- Cryptocurrency: STX (Stacks Token), with plans to integrate Bitcoin

## Current State

The project is in its initial development phase. The current implementation includes:

1. Basic content registration system
2. Simple licensing mechanism
3. License validity checking

## Setup

To set up and interact with this project, you'll need:

1. A Stacks wallet (e.g., Hiro Wallet)
2. Clarinet for local development and testing

### Installation

1. Install Clarinet by following the instructions at [Clarinet Documentation](https://docs.hiro.so/smart-contracts/clarinet)
2. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone [repository-url]
   cd digital-content-licensing-platform
   ```
3. Initialize the Clarinet project:

```clarity
(contract-call? .digital-content-licensing-platform add-content "My Content Title" "image" u100 "Standard license terms")
```

### For Users

To purchase a license:

```clarity
(contract-call? .digital-content-licensing-platform purchase-license u1)
```

To check if a license is valid:

```clarity
(contract-call? .digital-content-licensing-platform is-license-valid u1)
```

## Roadmap
